### Agile in NextJS

First we would have to draw 4 column system.

🧠 Backlog | 👷 In Progress | ✅ Publish | 🎯 Review

Once you put the tasks on the board, you can see the order of the tasks from: 🧠 Backlog > 👷 In Progress > ✅ Publish > 🎯 Review and then, once you ended to code that component, as obviusly, you will need to develop the next one, so you return to 🧠 Backlog > 👷 In Progress > ✅ Publish > 🎯 Review with the new component, and one after one, repeatit until you have all the components done.
Then to upgrade components or add new components, you can just move the component to the next folder, and the order of the imports will be added susbecuencely the enumerations.

The second main feature of The SushiJS Framework is the ability to create components that are reusable but not necessarily general for all the pages. This is the reason why we have created the "uncommon" folder. This folder is part of the framework, and it is an extra way create components that are not general for all the pages. It contains, the same strcuture until you navigate to the "elements" folder, and the order of the imports is customizable 100% by the developer.

For example:
 - src/uncommon/components/elementsbypage/Home
 - src/uncommon/components/elementsbypage/AboutUs
 - src/uncommon/components/elementsbypage/ContactUs
 - src/uncommon/components/elementsbypage/Menu

Inside this folders you will encounter a basic folder:

    - 00 Header
    - 01 Head
    - 02 Body
    - 03 Footer

In every page, that is the reason why we have created the "uncommon" folder, it is not a folder you will use everyday, it's uncommonly to use, but is there in case you need for example, to create a specific component, for a specific page for: testing purpouse, SEO or a specific component as mentioned before, like a custome menu.

## Introduction to Common Internet Language also CIL

Code Internet Language also CIL defined and term designed by ITAMAESAN from Miguel Gargallo in Andorra La Vella, Andorra, is to enumarate folders into a web dynamic project, to ensure a faster, reliable and efficient identification for:

    - Fast Error enclave communication.
    - Fast Error identification
    - Easy Dev to Dev communication language
    - Efficient shortened  name of high paths of files
    
eg

    -   ./src/common/components/elements/02 Body/03 Carrousel/index.ts:1:10
    
it converts into CIL, the ans is:
    
   -    C0203 or C-02/03
       
If we see the folder Strucuture:

            ▒   ▒   ▒       ▒   ⬛️---03 Footer    

You will notice, there is no error identifyn between a common and an ucommon component.
This how at SushiJS we solved many problems, making quicker, easier and common understandable, between devs, and non devs, also PM who knows to code but do need to know how the folder file system strcututire is, why and how to arrive to their destination.

# Code Internet Language in a real case use.

We use 00 01 02 03 and many more identifications to locate so fast, efficient and reliable an error when is higlighted on the compile, server or in this case, VERCEL.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5947268/186480899-6200dc29-5b22-4fbc-a463-e547f4d2e63b.png)

As you may see in this picture,

        ./src/common/components/elements/02 Body/27 Carrousel/index.ts:1:10
        
If we looked deeper:

        ./...common/.../02...27...

Here is the reference: C0227 or also C-02/27, where the error is being easely to remember, anotate on your Agile tools and pas throught the notes into devs to fix ASAP, with an easy message, "fix please C0227", here is where we introduce the Code Internet Language also CIL.

# NRNx2 Agile by ITAMAESAN

SuhsiJS introduced the NRNx2 Agile subsystem folder structure and development methodology.

This is the first main aspects of SushiJS, here you will find out a Project Management System, a simple and easy to use system to manage your folders.

- [Back to top 🔼](#Project-Organizer)


## Project Management System

It's based on Agile methodology, it's a system to manage your projects and tasks.

- [Back to top 🔼](#Project-Organizer)


### Features

Directories are the main feature of this system, you can create, delete, rename and move directories, but always under a precise level of numerical identification.
The following identification levels are available:
 - 00 Header
 - 01 Head
 - 02 Body
 - 03 Footer

Inside those directories, you will encounter a second independent system of enumeration, this system is called the NRNx2 Agile, introduced by Miguel Gargallo, a software engineer student and a project manager. He studied at Harvard University and is the main developer at SushiJS.

# Why NRNx2
NRN means Next Right Now, and x2 means the addition of SushiJS Agile, a Numerical Reference Number, NRN, a system to manage the numerical identification of the directories.

## NRNx2 Agile

Between 00 Header and 01 Head there is no main difference at all. The only difference is the order of the imports internally.
When you navigate to 02 Body, you will see that the order of the imports is a continuation of the order of the imports in 00 Header, and not a reset of the order in every directory.
If you delete the main folders:
    - 00 Header
    - 01 Head
    - 02 Body
    - 03 Footer

    More precisely, the following files are exported:

    ▒   ▒   ▒       ⬜️---00 Header
    ▒   ▒   ▒       ▒   ⬛️---00 Meta

And move all directories to the root of the elements project folder, you will see that the order of the imports is functional too.
The system is developed to be easy for non relates heavy developers, or also called head of areas, or project managers Who know the basis of the programming skills, but do not know the order of the imports or projects specifications at all.
This also enables a way to order tasks as the Agile Scrum Manifesto states.

# Create T3 App Sushis App

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

## Why are there `.js` files in here?

As per [T3-Axiom #3](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app/tree/next#3-typesafety-isnt-optional), we take typesafety as a first class citizen. Unfortunately, not all frameworks and plugins support TypeScript which means some of the configuration files have to be `.js` files.

We try to emphasize that these files are javascript for a reason, by explicitly declaring its type (`cjs` or `mjs`) depending on what's supported by the library it is used by. Also, all the `js` files in this project are still typechecked using a `@ts-check` comment at the top.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with the most basic configuration and then move on to more advanced configuration.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

## How do I deploy this?

### Vercel

We recommend deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss). It makes it super easy to deploy NextJs apps.

- Push your code to a GitHub repository.
- Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss) and sign up with GitHub.
- Create a Project and import the repository you pushed your code to.
- Add your environment variables.
- Click **Deploy**
- Now whenever you push a change to your repository, Vercel will automatically redeploy your website!

### Docker

You can also dockerize this stack and deploy a container.

Please note that Next.js requires a different process for buildtime (available in the frontend, prefixed by `NEXT_PUBLIC`) and runtime environment, server-side only, variables. In this demo we are using two variables, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO` and `BAR`. Pay attention to their positions in the `Dockerfile`, command-line arguments, and `docker-compose.yml`.

1. In your [next.config.mjs](./next.config.mjs), add the `standalone` output-option to your config:

   ```diff
     export default defineNextConfig({
       reactStrictMode: true,
       swcMinify: true,
   +   output: "standalone",
     });
   ```

2. Remove the `env`-import from [next.config.mjs](./next.config.mjs):

   ```diff
   - import { env } from "./src/env/server.mjs";
   ```

3. Create a `.dockerignore` file with the following contents:
   <details>
   <summary>.dockerignore</summary>

   ```
   .env
   Dockerfile
   .dockerignore
   node_modules
   npm-debug.log
   README.md
   .next
   .git
   ```

  </details>

4. Create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents:
   <details>
   <summary>Dockerfile</summary>

   ```Dockerfile
   ########################
   #         DEPS         #
   ########################

   # Install dependencies only when needed
   # TODO: re-evaluate if emulation is still necessary on arm64 after moving to node 18

   # Check https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/tree/b4117f9333da4138b03a546ec926ef50a31506c3#nodealpine to understand why libc6-compat might be needed.
   RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
   WORKDIR /app

   # Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
   COPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
   RUN \
     if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn --frozen-lockfile; \
     elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; \
     elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then yarn global add pnpm && pnpm i; \
     else echo "Lockfile not found." && exit 1; \
     fi

   ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO
   ARG BAR

   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
   COPY . .

   # Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
   # Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry
   # Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during the build.
   # ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

   RUN \
     if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn build; \
     elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm run build; \
     elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then yarn global add pnpm && pnpm run build; \
     else echo "Lockfile not found." && exit 1; \
     fi

   USER nextjs

   EXPOSE 3000

   ENV PORT 3000

   CMD ["node", "server.js"]
   ```

  </details>

5. To build and run this image locally, run:

   ```bash
   docker build -t ct3a -e NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO=foo .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -e BAR="bar" ct3a
   ```

6. You can also use a PaaS such as [Railway's](https://railway.app) automated [Dockerfile deployments](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/dockerfiles) to deploy your app.

### docker-compose

You can also use docker-compose to build and run the container.

1. Follow steps 1-4 above

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following:

   <details>
   <summary>docker-compose.yml</summary>

   ```yaml
   version: "3.7"
   services:
     app:
       platform: "linux/amd64"
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
         args:
           NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO: "foo"
       working_dir: /app
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       image: t3-app
       environment:
         - BAR=bar
   ```

   </details>

3. Run this using `docker-compose up`.
